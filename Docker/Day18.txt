Port Mapping

docker run -itd --name <ContainerName> -p <HostPortNo.>:<ContainerPortNo.> <ImageName>:<VersionNo.>

Host Port	- this is the port on docker host machine. Using this port we have to access the app running inside the container. Host port can be changed to any number of our convenience. host port should be opened in the SG of VM, only then we can access the application on browser.
Container Port	- this is the port inside the container where the application is running. Whatever port that we have mentioned inside the Dockerfile as EXPOSE, that is considered as container port

USER
We can set an username for an image or a container

USER <UserName>

AUTHOR
We will define who is the author of the dockerfile

AUTHOR <AuthorName>

ARGS
It is used to avoid the hardcoding values in the dockerfile
ARGS will be passed on a container
These are the variables which runs outside of a container

ENTRYPOINT
These instructions will be executed while creating the container
These instructions cannot be overwritten. CMD instructions can be overwritten

MAINTAINER
It represents the author/maintainer of the dockerfile

MAINTAINER <AuthoName> <AuthorEmail> <ProjectName>

VOLUMES
It is used to store data
Docker Volumes
If you want to store the data permanently then we will use Docker Volumes concept.

==> DOCKER VOLUMES
Volume - Storage
It is just a folder inside a container
We will use docker volumes to store the data of docker containers
The docker volumes are also called as Persistent Volumes
A volume can be shared between multiple containers

Method 1: Creating volumes using Dockerfile
FROM ubuntu
VOLUME ["volume1"]

docker volume ls

Method 2: Sharing the volume b/w containers
Volume 1 ----> Container 1

 docker run -it --name container2 --volumes-from container1 ubuntu

Method 3: Creating a volume using command
docker run -it --name container4 -v /volume2 ubuntu

Method 4: Creation of volume on host machine and attaching it with a container

Method 5: Creation of EBS Volume and attaching with Container

==> Installation of Jenkins using Docker
docker run -itd --name jenkins -p 8080:8080 jenkins/jenkins

docker kill $(docker ps -aq)			----> To kill all the containers 
docker rm $(docker ps -aq)			----> To remove all the containers
docker rmi -f $(docker images -q)		----> To delete all the images

==> DOCKER COMPOSE
To automate the creation of multiple containers we will use DOCKER-COMPOSE
Docker-compose is used to deploy microservices applications
It is a tool used to define and run multi-container applications
Instead of running multiple docker run commands manually, we will automate by writing "docker-compose.yml"

YML or YAML ---> Yet Another Markup Language

docker-compose up
