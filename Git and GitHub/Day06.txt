11.00 AM ---> TL ---> create a file, added python code in the file, add to staging area, commit it
11.30 AM ---> TL ---> create another new file called Netflix.java, add to staging area, commit it

We should never add, commit and push the partially completed work
We shouldn't delete the file as well
We have to add the partially completed work in a temporary location which is available in the .git folder ----> git stash <FileName>
