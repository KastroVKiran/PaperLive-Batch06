Types of users in Linux OS;
By default we will have two types of users;
	1. ec2-user (for amazon Linux AMIs), ubuntu (for ubuntu AMIs)	- who has least privileges/permissions 
	2. root	- which has all the permissions

How to switch to root user?
sudo su (or) sudo -I

If you see $ at the end of a line, it means you are "ec2-user"
If you see # at the end of a line, it means you are "root" user
