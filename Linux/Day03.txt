Default landing commands;
sudo su

Linux Directory Structure;
cd / ----> pwd ----> You will see as / ----> ls ---> You will see the default directory structure

While working with switching from one directory to another directory, we have two types of paths;
	1. Absolute Path	- it means we should give the complete path in a single command (Eg: cd /home/ec2-user/kastro/kiran/)
	2. Relative Path	- it means we need to go inside one specific directory (Eg: cd /kastro, cd /kiran, cd /kk)

WHICH
To know in which path the commands are available in Linux directory structure
	which mkdir
	which pwd

MAN
To know the information about a specific command
	man ls
	man mkdir
	
HOSTNAME
hostname -i
hostnamectl set-hostname <Name>
sudo -i
hostname

uptime ----> To see from how long the VM is running

To see the list of packages installed
yum list available
dnf list available

cat	- to display the content in normal order
tac	- to display the content in reverse order

To print the line numbers along with the content
cat -n <FileName>

To see the list of commands executed so far
history

COPY


shift + a
shift + i
shift + o
Insert a line below an existing line
shift + g

To see the number of lines available (when using vi command)
:set number

To go to a specific line
:<LineNumber>

To copy a line
yy

To paste the copied line
p

To delete a line
dd

To undo
u

To redo
control + r

To search for a specific word in a file
/<WordName>

To delete everything that is in a file
:%d

GREP - Global Regular Expression Print
GREP is used to search for a word
GREP will process teh text line by line and prints the lines which contains that word
When using GREP, we dont have to open a file

grep '<WordName>' <FileName> ----> This is case sensitive
grep -i '<WordName>' <FileName> ----> This is not case sensitive

SED - Stream Editor
SED is used to process the data (substitute, delete, print, insert)
using SED we can replace the text without opening a file

FILE PERMISSIONS IN LINUX
chmod

For any file/directory, in Linux we have 3 categories of permissions;
Users (u)
Groups (g)
Others (o)

For every category we have 3 file permissions;
read (r)
write (w)
execute (x)

rw-r--r--  kastro.txt

first 3 represents --- users category --- rw- (users can read the data, can write the data, cannot execute)
2nd 3 represents --- group category --- r-- (group can read the data, cannot write the data, cannot execute)
3rd 3 represents --- others category --- r-- (other can read the data, cannot write the data, cannot execute)
