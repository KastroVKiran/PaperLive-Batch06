Linux - Day 01
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
=> What is an OS?
OS is a software which is used to interact with the machine
It acts as mediator between user and the machine
OS is mandatory to use any device
It provides an environment to run applications

=> Types of OS
Windows, macOS, Linux/Ubuntu

=> Windows Vs Linux OS
Windows OS is meant for personal use
Linux OS is meant for professional use

Window OS is not free
Linux OS is free and open source

Window OS has security issues
Linux OS is highly secure

Windows OS is developed by Microsoft
Linux OS is developed by Linus Torvalds

Windows OS is GUI based
Linux OS is CLI based - Command Line Interface - Commands

=> Linux Distributions (Distros)
A Linux distribution (distro) is an OS that is built on Linux Kernel
In AWS Cloud, most of these distributions are available as Amazon Machine Image (AMI)
	1. RPM based (RedHat Package Manager)
		RedHat
		Cent OS
		Amazon Linux 2023** - 6.1 & 6.12
	2. Debian based
		Ubuntu** - 2024
		Suse

=> Launch an EC2 Instance
AWS Account -----> Navigate to EC2 Service -----> Launch Instance(s) 

=> Connecting with the Instance (VM)
Multiple approaches;
	1. AWS Console
	2. 3rd party tools - MobaXTerm**, Putty & PuttyGen

=> Linux Architecture
It has 3 main layers;
	Shell
	Kernel
	Hardware Components

Shell is a mediator between user and kernel
It will read commands/instructions executed by the users
Validate the command syntax
Convert command into Kernel understandable language

Kernel is heart of Linux OS
It will receive instructions from shell
Kernel will covert commands into hardware understandable format
It is a mediator between shell and hardware components

Hardware components includes physical components of a machine (CPU, RAM, Harddisk, Network Card, etc...)

Free tier limits;
750 hours per month

N.Virginia (us-east-1)	--- 1 VM --- 750 free hours per month
					--- 2 VMs --- 750/2 = 375 free hours per month per VM
					--- 3 VMs --- 750/3 = 250 free hours per month per VM

Steps;
Name: Linux Server (Optional)
AMI: Select the OS
Instance Type: represents the functionality of VM
Keypair: It is used to connect with the instance
			.pem	- MobaXTerm (Privacy Enhanced Mail)
			.ppk		- Putty & PuttyGen (PuTTY Private Key)
Network:
	use Default Network (VPC - Virtual Private Cloud)
Storage:
	Free tier limits: 30 GB
