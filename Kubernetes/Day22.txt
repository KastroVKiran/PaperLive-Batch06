K8s Services
----------------------------------------
A K8s service is a way to expose our application which is running inside a pod - within cluster, outside the cluster
within the cluster ---- backend code
outside the cluster ---- a real application

The manifest file which is used to create a pod is known as "Pod Manifest File"
The manifest file which is used to create a service is known as "Service Manifest File"

Types of services;
1. ClusterIP (default service)
2. NodePort
3. Load Balancer
4. External Name - ingress controller
5. Headless Service - statefulset

1. ClusterIP
You can access the application with in the cluster only
Pods are ephemeral - pod IPs will change - it gives a stable virtual IP (VIP)

Labels are used to identify the pod --- pod labels
service will identity using selectors

kubectl get pods
kubectl get svc

kubectl delete svc <ServiceName>
kubectl delete pod <PodName>


2. NodePort
NodePort is a service type in k8s that exposes our application to be accessible externally (outside the cluster)
The port range for NodePort is in between 30000-32767
If you dont provide NodePort IP in the service manifest file, by default k8s will allocate a random port number with in the range (30000-32767)
To access the application: NodePublicIP:NodePort

3. Load Balancer
It is also used to access the application using Load Balancer URL externally
Load Balancer service will create Load Balancer in the AWS Cloud

Configuring the IPs of worker nodes becomes complex when we want to route the traffic to a custom domain
But if we have load balancer, we can directly configure load balancer URL with custom domain

LB URL -----> www.zomato.com

													Worker Nodes <----- LB URL <------ www.zomato.com

Load Balancer internally uses NodePort

Microservices ---- 10 microservices ---- 10 load balancers will get created
We will use ingress controller to deploy microservices based application

K8s Namespaces
----------------------------------------
Namespace is an isolated environment for different applications running in the cluster

Zomato	--- Same cluster --- same namespace
Swiggy	--- Same cluster --- same namespace

Teams -- dev team , test team, prod team

kubectl get ns
kubectl create ns dev
kubectl get all -n dev
kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=dev


RBAC - Roll Based Access Control
