Kubernetes

K8s
It is an open source container orchestration platform that automates;
	Deployment
	Scaling
	Load Balancing
	Manage the containerized applications

Developed by Google 2014
CNCF maintains from 2015

Why we need K8s?
Multiple containers
	- update them
	- make sure they dont go down
	- restart all of them, if they fail

K8s automates all of the above things

Docker Swarm Vs K8s

Event organizer -----> Docker Swarm			K8s

What is a cluster?
Cluster means group of servers that work together to run containerized applications

Cluster components;
1. Control Plane / Master Node
	- manages scheduling, scaling, monitoring

2. Worker Node(s)
	- each nodes run containers inside POD

K8s Architecture

Cluster types;
1. Self managed k8s cluster
	1.1 minikube - single node cluster - for beginners
	1.2. kubeadm - multi node cluster - manual maintenance 
	1.3 kops	- multi node cluster - manual maintenance
	1.4 kubespray
	1.5 kind
	1.6 Rancher

2. Managed k8s cluster
	2.1 AWS	- EKS (Elastic K8s Service)
	2.2 GCP		- GKE (Google K8s Engine)
	2.3 Azure	- AKE (Azure K8s Engine)


How to create a cluster?
CLI
AWS Console
Terraform

Note: All the k8s deployments we will be doing in EKS Cluster
Note: Expect a minimum of 1000 Rs

K8s Resources

Creation of resources;
1. Declarative	- manifest yml files - execute the yml file ----> Resource will get created ----> Extension: .yml or .yaml - Production level
2. Imperative	- command execution ---> kubectl run nginx-pod --image=nginx

Why we prefer Manifest files?
	Automation
	Clarity
	Reusability

While writing the manifest files, the most important thing is "DOCKER IMAGE" 
Writing the Dockerfile, building the docker image, tagging the docker image, pushing the docker image to docker hub is all what we do with DOCKER
This docker image which is available in the dockerhub, will configured in the k8s manifest file

Structure of a manifest file;
apiVersion
Defines the k8s apiVersion (Ex: v1, apps/v1,...)
Different resources have different API versions


kind
we will define what k8s resource we want to create


metadata
contains the info about the k8s resource


spec
define which image is used to create a pod
define container name
