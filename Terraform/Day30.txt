To automate the infra creation, we will use Terraform
IaaC - Infrastructure as a Code

Terraform was launched in 2014, developed by Hashicorp
Developed by using Go Programming Language
Terraform files will be written to automate the infrastructure creation
.tf

Alternatives;
Open Tofu (forked version of terraform), Pulimi, AWS - Cloud Formation

Terraform is cloud independent

3 important files;
main.tf
variables.tf
output.tf

projectname/
	provider.tf		- provider configurations - plugin to connect to the cloud - provider "aws"
	version.tf		- sets the required terraform and provider version
	backend.tf		- this file is used to configure the backend, which determines how and where terraform stores its data (terraform.tf state in latest versions)
	main.tf			- contains the core resource definitions
	variables.tf		- declare input variables
	terraform.tfvars	- values are declared
	output.tf			- output values


backend.tf - 5 VMs using terraform and 3 VMs directly launched
the data related to infrastructure created by using terraform will be maintained in a file which is known as "state file" - "backend.tf"

Terraform Architecture
terraform init			- initialize terraform - downloads provider plugins
terraform validate		- verify terraform script syntax
terraform fmt			- to arrange the terraform file structure
terraform plan		- to see the information of the resources that may be/can be created by using .tf files
terraform apply		- it is used to create the resources using .tf file
terraform destroy		- it is used to delete the resources created by using .tf files

Components of a .tf file
Blocks
Labels
Arguments

we cannot use space between the words. we will combine the words using _
Ex: aws instance -- wrong
aws_instance --right
_ is identifier

Terraform Installation Commands;
sudo yum install -y yum-utils
sudo yum-config-manager --add-repo https://rpm.releases.hashicorp.com/AmazonLinux/hashicorp.repo
sudo yum -y install terraform
terraform --version

+ ---> Creation
- ---> Deletion
~ ---> Updating

JSON


current state --- actual state of infr. resources --- tracks this by using terraform.tfstate file
desired state --- it is what you define in the configuration files --- main.tf file

VARIABLES
1. length(list) - print the number of variables defined
2. element	- print the specific variable
3. concat	- combine multiple lists into a single list
4. zipmap	- create a map from a list of keys and list of values
